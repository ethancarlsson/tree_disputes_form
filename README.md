# # tree-dispute-helper
A web application designed to assist self-represented litigants with filling out their applications to court in the Trees (Disputes Between Neighbours) jurisdiction of NSW.

The live app can be found here http://www.treedisputehelper.com/. It is very similar but uses a Postgres database.

<h1> How to use it </h1>

Simply answer the questions questions acurrately and it will write on the relevant forms for you and tell you which aspects of the forms are relevant to you.

<h1> Future developments </h1>

This is a very early version. Future versions will make it possible for users to write directly to the document from the web app and will assist with other aspects of the process.
